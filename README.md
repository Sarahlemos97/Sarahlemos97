- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sarahlemos97/Sarah Lemos
- 👀 I’m interested in gain knowledge in the various areas of programming and meet people who can help me with this.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning I am studying in several different places about Programming Logic, so that I can start studying with Java. That's it for now, but I want to develop many more programming skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solving problems, repairing software, creating tools and many other situations, when I can get the experience and knowledge necessary to perform.
- 📫 How to reach me by email: sarahkarine1@gmail.com
