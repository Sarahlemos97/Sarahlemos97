- 👋 Hi, I'm @Sarahlemos97/Sarah Lemos. Welcome to my GitHub.
- 👀 I'm interested in acquiring knowledge in different areas of programming and meeting people who can help me with this.
- 🌱 I'm currently expanding my knowledge in Front-End with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap, see some of my projects below. I'm looking to learn more about Back-End and Database.
- 💞️ I try to collaborate in problem solving, software repair, tool creation and many other situations, when I can obtain the necessary experience and knowledge to act.I am looking for work opportunities in my areas of knowledge so that I can develop my skills and achieve professional growth.
